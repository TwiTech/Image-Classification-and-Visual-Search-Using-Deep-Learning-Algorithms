## Image Classification and Visual Search for Fashion Items
Using Deep Learning Algorithms

This research was conducted to improve the efficiency of ecommerce by improving the classification and visual search of
fashion products’ images utilizing learnings from deep learning. The
research utilized the VGG19 model for classification which achieved
high accuracy, precision, recall, and an impressive AUC score. The
results, therefore, demonstrate that the VGG19 model is capable of
capturing the small features that are highly useful in classification.
Furthermore, a CNN autoencoder integrated with ResNet-50 was used
for visual search which retrieved visually similar images proving
practical approach to enhancing the use’s convenience of e-commerce
platform.
